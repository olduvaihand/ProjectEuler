 * Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3,
 * 4.  Colin has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3,
 * 4, 5, 6. Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest
 * total wins. The result is a draw if the totals are equal. What is the
 * probability that Pyramidal Pete beats Cubic Colin? Give your answer rounded
 * to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg
