 * In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are
 * eight coins in general circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and
 * £2 (200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way: 1£1 + 150p + 220p
 * + 15p + 12p + 31p How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of
 * coins?
