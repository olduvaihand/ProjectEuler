 * Non-bouncy numbers
 * ==================
 * Published on Friday, 10th February 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left
 * it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468. Similarly if no digit
 * is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for
 * example, 66420. We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing
 * nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349. As n increases, the
 * proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such that there are only 12951
 * numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy
 * numbers below 1010. How many numbers below a googol (10100) are not bouncy?
