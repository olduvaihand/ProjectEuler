 * Sum of a square and a cube
 * ==========================
 * Published on Saturday, 3rd September 2011, 04:00 pm
 *
 * Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them
 * in more than one way. Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed
 * as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4
 * different ways.  For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be
 * expressed in exactly 4 different ways: 22852 + 203  22232 + 663  18102 + 1253
 * 11972 + 1563 Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
