 * Investigating the primality of numbers of the form 2n2-1
 * ========================================================
 * Published on Friday, 7th November 2008, 05:00 pm
 *
 * Consider numbers t(n) of the form t(n) = 2n2-1 with n  1.  The first such
 * numbers are 7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127 and 161.  It turns out that only 49 =
 * 7*7 and 161 = 7*23 are not prime.  For n  10000 there are 2202 numbers t(n)
 * that are prime. How many numbers t(n) are prime for n  50,000,000 ?
