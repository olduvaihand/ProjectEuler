 * Bitwise-OR operations on random integers
 * ========================================
 * Published on Sunday, 6th February 2011, 07:00 am
 *
 * Let y0, y1, y2,... be a sequence of random unsigned 32 bit integers  (i.e. 0
 * yi  232, every value equally likely). For the sequence xi the following
 * recursion is given:  x0 = 0 and xi = xi-1 | yi-1, for i  0. ( | is the
 * bitwise-OR operator)  It can be seen that eventually there will be an index N
 * such that xi = 232 -1 (a bit-pattern of all ones) for all i  N. Find the
 * expected value of N.   Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the
 * decimal point.
