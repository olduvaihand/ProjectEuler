 * Minkowski Sums
 * ==============
 * Published on Saturday, 17th January 2009, 05:00 am
 *
 * Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices     vk (k =
 * 1,2,…,n) have coordinates:    xk   =            cos( 2k-1/n 180° )   yk   =
 * sin( 2k-1/n 180° )   Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape
 * consisting of all points on the perimeter and in the interior. The Minkowski
 * sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of     adding every point in S
 * to every point in T, where point addition is performed coordinate-wise:
 * (u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y). For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-
 * sided shape shown in pink below:   How many sides does S1864 + S1865 + … +
 * S1909 have?
