 * Circumscribed Circles
 * =====================
 * Published on Saturday, 25th February 2012, 04:00 pm
 *
 * Every triangle has a circumscribed circle that goes through the three
 * vertices.  Consider all integer sided triangles for which the radius of the
 * circumscribed circle is integral as well.     Let S(n) be the sum of the
 * radii of the circumscribed circles of all such triangles for which the radius
 * does not exceed n.   S(100)=4950 and S(1200)=1653605.     Find S(107).
