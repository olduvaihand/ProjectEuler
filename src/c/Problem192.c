 * Best Approximations
 * ===================
 * Published on Saturday, 3rd May 2008, 05:00 am
 *
 * Let x be a real number.  A best approximation to x for the denominator bound
 * d is a rational number r/s in reduced form, with s  d, such that any rational
 * number which is closer to x than r/s has a denominator larger than d: |p/q-x|
 * |r/s-x|  q  d For example, the best approximation to 13 for the denominator
 * bound 20 is 18/5 and the best approximation to 13 for the denominator bound
 * 30 is 101/28. Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to
 * n for the denominator bound 1012, where n is not a perfect square and 1  n
 * 100000.
