 * ============================
 * Published on Sunday, 25th March 2012, 05:00 am
 *
 * There are 16 positive integers that do not have a zero in their digits and
 * that have a digital sum equal to 5, namely:   5, 14, 23, 32, 41, 113, 122,
 * 131, 212, 221, 311, 1112, 1121, 1211, 2111 and 11111.  Their sum is 17891.
 * Let f(n) be the sum of all positive integers that do not have a zero in their
 * digits and have a digital sum equal to n.     Find .  Give the last 9 digits
 * as your answer.
