 * Prime cube partnership
 * ======================
 * Published on Friday, 10th November 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n,
 * such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube. For example, when p =
 * 19, 83 + 8219 = 123. What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime
 * with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such
 * primes below one-hundred. How many primes below one million have this
 * remarkable property?
