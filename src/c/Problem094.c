 * Almost equilateral triangles
 * ============================
 * Published on Friday, 29th April 2005, 06:00 pm
 *
 * It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length
 * sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has
 * an area of 12 square units. We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to
 * be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more
 * than one unit. Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral
 * triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not
 * exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).
