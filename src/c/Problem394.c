 * Eating pie
 * ==========
 * Published on Saturday, 15th September 2012, 08:00 pm
 *
 * Jeff eats a pie in an unusual way.  The pie is circular. He starts with
 * slicing an initial cut in the pie along a radius.  While there is at least a
 * given fraction F of pie left, he performs the following procedure:  - He
 * makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is remaining of the
 * pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally likely. This will
 * divide the remaining pie into three pieces.   - Going counterclockwise from
 * the initial cut, he takes the first two pie pieces and eats them.  When less
 * than a fraction F of pie remains, he does not repeat this procedure. Instead,
 * he eats all of the remaining pie.
