 * Prime permutations
 * ==================
 * Published on Friday, 1st August 2003, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms
 * increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are
 * prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.
 * There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes,
 * exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.
 * What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this
 * sequence?
