 * Four Representations using Squares
 * ==================================
 * Published on Saturday, 24th January 2009, 09:00 am
 *
 * Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because   3600 = 482 +     362
 * 3600 = 202 + 2402  3600 = 302 + 3302  3600 = 452 + 7152  Similarly, we find
 * that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2542 = 2832 + 3522 = 1972 + 7842. In 1747,
 * Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.  We are
 * interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the
 * following four types:  n = a12 +   b12 n = a22 + 2 b22 n = a32 + 3 b32 n =
 * a72 + 7 b72,   where the ak and bk are positive integers. There are 75373
 * such numbers that do not exceed 107.    How many such numbers are there that
 * do not exceed 2109?
