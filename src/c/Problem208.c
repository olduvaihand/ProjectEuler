 *
 * A robot moves in a series of one-fifth circular arcs (72°), with a free
 * choice of a clockwise or an anticlockwise arc for each step, but no turning
 * on the spot. One of 70932 possible closed paths of 25 arcs starting northward
 * is    Given that the robot starts facing North, how many journeys of 70 arcs
 * in length can it take that return it, after the final arc, to its starting
 * position?   (Any arc may be traversed multiple times.)
