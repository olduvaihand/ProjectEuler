 * In a standard 52 card deck of playing cards, a set of 4 cards is a Badugi if
 * it contains 4 cards with no pairs and no two cards of the same suit. Let f(n)
 * be the number of ways to choose n cards with a 4 card subset that is a
 * Badugi.  For example, there are 2598960 ways to choose five cards from a
 * standard 52 card deck, of which 514800 contain a 4 card subset that is a
 * Badugi, so f(5) = 514800. Find f(n)  for 4  n  13.
