 * Amazing Mazes!
 * ==============

 *
 * An mn maze is an mn rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells
 * such that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to any other
 * square. The following are examples of a 912 maze and a 1520 maze:        Let
 * C(m,n) be the number of distinct mn mazes. Mazes which can be formed by
 * rotation and reflection from another maze are considered distinct.     It can
 * be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and C(9,12) =
 * 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).  Find
 * C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5
 * significant digits.     When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to
 * separate mantissa and exponent.  E.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the
 * answer format would be 1.2346e12.
