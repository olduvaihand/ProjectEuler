 * Crack-free Walls
 * ================
 * Published on Friday, 31st October 2008, 01:00 pm
 *
 * Consider the problem of building a wall out of 21 and 31 bricks
 * (horizontalvertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps
 * between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers,
 * i.e. never form a "running crack". For example, the following 93 wall is not
 * acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:    There are eight ways of
 * forming a crack-free 93 wall, written W(9,3) = 8. Calculate W(32,10).
