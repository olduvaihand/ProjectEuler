 * Pandigital Fibonacci ends
 * =========================
 * Published on Friday, 9th September 2005, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: Fn = Fn1 + Fn2,
 * where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1. It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits,
 * is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9
 * pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And
 * F2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the
 * first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital. Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci
 * number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9
 * pandigital, find k.
