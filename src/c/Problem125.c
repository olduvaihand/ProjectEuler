 * Palindromic sums
 * ================
 * Published on Friday, 4th August 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the
 * sum of consecutive squares: 62 + 72 + 82 + 92 + 102 + 112 + 122. There are
 * exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as
 * consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that
 * 1 = 02 + 12 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the
 * squares of positive integers. Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108
 * that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive
 * squares.
