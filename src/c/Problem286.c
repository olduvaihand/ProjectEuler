 * Scoring probabilities
 * =====================
 * Published on Saturday, 3rd April 2010, 05:00 am
 *
 * Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the
 * probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is exactly (1
 * - x/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50. During each practice run,
 * she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2, ..., x = 50 and, according to
 * her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20
 * points. Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
