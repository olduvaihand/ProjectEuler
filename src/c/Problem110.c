 * Diophantine reciprocals II
 * ==========================
 * Published on Friday, 2nd December 2005, 06:00 pm
 *
 * In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.    1 x  +  1 y
 * =  1 n    It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct
 * solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of
 * distinct solutions exceeds one hundred. What is the least value of n for
 * which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million? NOTE: This
 * problem is a much more difficult version of problem 108 and as it is well
 * beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever
 * implementation.
