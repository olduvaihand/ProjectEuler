 * abc-hits

 * The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of distinct prime factors of n. For
 * example, 504 = 23  32  7, so rad(504) = 2  3  7 = 42. We shall define the
 * triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an abc-hit if:  GCD(a, b) =
 * GCD(a, c) = GCD(b, c) = 1 a  b a + b = c rad(abc)  c  For example, (5, 27,
 * 32) is an abc-hit, because:  GCD(5, 27) = GCD(5, 32) = GCD(27, 32) = 1 5  27
 * 5 + 27 = 32 rad(4320) = 30  32  It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and
 * there are only thirty-one abc-hits for c  1000, with c = 12523. Find c for c
 * 120000.
