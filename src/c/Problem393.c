 * Migrating ants
 * ==============
 * Published on Saturday, 8th September 2012, 05:00 pm
 *
 * An  nn grid of squares contains  n2 ants, one ant per square.  All ants
 * decide to move simultaneously to an adjacent square (usually 4 possibilities,
 * except for ants on the edge of the grid or at the corners).  We define f(n)
 * to be the number of ways this can happen without any ants ending on the same
 * square and without any two ants crossing the same edge between two squares.
 * You are given that f(4) = 88.  Find  f(10).
