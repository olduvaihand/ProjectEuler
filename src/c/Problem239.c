 * Twenty-two Foolish Primes
 * =========================
 * Published on Friday, 3rd April 2009, 05:00 pm
 *
 * A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random order.
 * What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that exactly
 * 22 prime number discs are found away from their natural positions?  (Any
 * number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their natural
 * positions.) Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in
 * the form 0.abcdefghijkl.
