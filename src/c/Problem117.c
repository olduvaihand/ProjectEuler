 * ==========================
 * Published on Friday, 10th March 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from: red
 * tiles measuring two units, green tiles measuring three units, and blue tiles
 * measuring four units, it is possible to tile a row measuring five units in
 * length in exactly fifteen different ways.
 * How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled? NOTE: This
 * is related to problem 116.
