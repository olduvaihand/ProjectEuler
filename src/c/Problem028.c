 * Number spiral diagonals
 * =======================
 * Published on Friday, 11th October 2002, 06:00 pm
 *
 * Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a
 * 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows: 21 22 23 24 25  20  7  8  9 10  19  6  1
 * 2 11  18  5  4  3 12 17 16 15 14 13 It can be verified that the sum of the
 * numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is the sum of the numbers on the
 * diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
