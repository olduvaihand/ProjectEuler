 * Prize Strings
 * =============

 * A particular school offers cash rewards to children with good attendance and
 * punctuality. If they are absent for three consecutive days or late on more
 * than one occasion then they forfeit their prize. During an n-day period a
 * trinary string is formed for each child consisting of L's (late), O's (on
 * time), and A's (absent). Although there are eighty-one trinary strings for a
 * 4-day period that can be formed, exactly forty-three strings would lead to a
 * prize: OOOO OOOA OOOL OOAO OOAA OOAL OOLO OOLA OAOO OAOA  OAOL OAAO OAAL OALO
 * OALA OLOO OLOA OLAO OLAA AOOO  AOOA AOOL AOAO AOAA AOAL AOLO AOLA AAOO AAOA
 * AAOL  AALO AALA ALOO ALOA ALAO ALAA LOOO LOOA LOAO LOAA  LAOO LAOA LAAO How
 * many "prize" strings exist over a 30-day period?
