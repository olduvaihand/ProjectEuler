 * Balanced Numbers
 * ================
 * Published on Friday, 14th November 2008, 09:00 pm
 *
 * A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first
 * k/2 digits sum to the same value as its last k/2 digits, where x, pronounced
 * ceiling of x, is the smallest integer  x, thus π = 4 and 5 = 5. So, for
 * example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722. Let T(n) be the sum of
 * all balanced numbers less than 10n.   Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) =
 * 334795890.  Find T(47) mod 315
