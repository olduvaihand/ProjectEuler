 * Pythagorean Polygons
 * ====================
 * Published on Saturday, 15th May 2010, 01:00 am
 *
 * We shall define a pythagorean polygon  to be a convex polygon with the
 * following properties:  there are at least three vertices, no three vertices
 * are aligned, each vertex has integer coordinates, each edge has integer
 * length. For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct
 * pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is  n.  Pythagorean polygons
 * should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.
 * You are given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045.  Find P(120).
