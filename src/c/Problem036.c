 * Double-base palindromes
 * =======================
 * Published on Friday, 31st January 2003, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.
 * Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in
 * base 10 and base 2. (Please note that the palindromic number, in either base,
 * may not include leading zeros.)
