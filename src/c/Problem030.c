 * Digit fifth powers
 * ==================
 * Published on Friday, 8th November 2002, 06:00 pm
 *
 * Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of
 * fourth powers of their digits: 1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44 8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 +
 * 84 9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44 As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included. The
 * sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316. Find the sum of all the
 * numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
