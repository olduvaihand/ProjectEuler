 * ===================
 * Published on Friday, 17th December 2004, 06:00 pm
 *
 * By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2
 * contains eighteen rectangles:    Although there exists no rectangular grid
 * that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with
 * the nearest solution.
