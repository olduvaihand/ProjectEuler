 * Perfect right-angled triangles
 * ==============================
 * Published on Saturday, 22nd November 2008, 01:00 am
 *
 * Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.  The area
 * of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
 * Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and
 * gcd(b,c)=1.  Also c is a perfect square. We will call a right angled triangle
 * perfect if  -it is a primitive right angled triangle  -its hypotenuse is a
 * perfect square We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if  -it is
 * a perfect right angled triangle and  -its area is a multiple of the perfect
 * numbers 6 and 28.   How many perfect right-angled triangles with c1016 exist
 * that are not super-perfect?
