 * Cubic permutations
 * ==================
 * Published on Friday, 30th January 2004, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes:
 * 56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube
 * which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube. Find
 * the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.
