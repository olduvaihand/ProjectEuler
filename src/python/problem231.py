# The prime factorisation of binomial coefficients

#
# The binomial coefficient 10C3 = 120.  120 = 23  3  5 = 2  2  2  3  5, and 2 +
# 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14.  So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of
# 10C3 is 14.    Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of
# 20000000C15000000.
