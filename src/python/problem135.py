# Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an
# arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, n, for which
# the equation, x2  y2  z2 = n, has exactly two solutions is n = 27: 342  272
# 202 = 122  92  62 = 27 It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which
# has exactly ten solutions. How many values of n less than one million have
# exactly ten distinct solutions?
