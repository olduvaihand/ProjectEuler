#
# For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its
# usual decimal representation.  Thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.     For a positive
# integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k < 10n with the
# following properties :   k is divisible by 23 and  d(k) = 23.     You are
# given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.
