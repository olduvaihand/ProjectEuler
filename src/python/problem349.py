# Langton's ant
# =============
# Published on Saturday, 3rd September 2011, 04:00 pm
#
# An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or
# white.   The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left,
# right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the
# following rules:  - if it is on a black square, it flips the color of the
# square to white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one
# square.  - if it is on a white square, it flips the color of the square to
# black, rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.    Starting
# with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after 1018
# moves of the ant?
