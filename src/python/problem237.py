# Let T(n) be the number of tours over a 4  n playing board such that:  The
# tour starts in the top left corner. The tour consists of moves that are up,
# down, left, or right one square. The tour visits each square exactly once.
# The tour ends in the bottom left corner.  The diagram shows one tour over a 4
# 10 board:   T(10) is 2329. What is T(1012) modulo 108?
