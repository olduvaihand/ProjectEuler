# Golomb's self-describing sequence
# =================================
# Published on Sunday, 5th June 2011, 10:00 am
#
# The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing
# sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the
# sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are
# n123456789101112131415… G(n)122334445556666… You are given that G(103) = 86,
# G(106) = 6137.  You are also given that ΣG(n3) = 153506976 for 1  n  103.
# Find ΣG(n3) for 1  n  106.
