# Let {a1, a2,..., an} be an integer sequence of length n such that:  a1 = 6
# for all 1  i < n : φ(ai) < φ(ai+1) < ai < ai+1 1  Let S(N) be the number of
# such sequences with an  N.  For example, S(10) = 4: {6}, {6, 8}, {6, 8, 9}
# and {6, 10}.  We can verify that S(100) = 482073668 and S(10 000) mod 108 =
# 73808307. Find S(20 000 000) mod 108. 1 φ denotes Euler's totient function.
