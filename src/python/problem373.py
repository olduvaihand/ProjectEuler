# Circumscribed Circles
# =====================
# Published on Saturday, 25th February 2012, 04:00 pm
#
# Every triangle has a circumscribed circle that goes through the three
# vertices.  Consider all integer sided triangles for which the radius of the
# circumscribed circle is integral as well.     Let S(n) be the sum of the
# radii of the circumscribed circles of all such triangles for which the radius
# does not exceed n.   S(100)=4950 and S(1200)=1653605.     Find S(107).
