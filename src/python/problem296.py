# Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with BC  AC  AB. k is the angular
# bisector of angle ACB. m is the tangent at C to the circumscribed circle of
# ABC. n is a line parallel to m through B.  The intersection of n and k is
# called E.      How many triangles ABC with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000
# exist such that BE has integral length?
