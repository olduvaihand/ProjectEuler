# Sum of squares of divisors

# The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6.  The sum of the squares of these numbers
# is 1+4+9+36=50.     Let sigma2(n) represent the sum of the squares of the
# divisors of n.  Thus sigma2(6)=50.    Let SIGMA2 represent the summatory
# function of sigma2, that is SIGMA2(n)=sigma2(i) for i=1 to n.  The first 6
# values of SIGMA2 are: 1,6,16,37,63 and 113.
