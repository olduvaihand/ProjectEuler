# Perfection Quotients
# ====================
# Published on Saturday, 18th April 2009, 02:00 am
#
# For a positive integer n, let σ(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g.
# σ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.   A perfect number, as you probably know, is a
# number with σ(n) = 2n.    Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive
# integer asp(n)=  σ(n)n .      Find the sum of all positive integers n  1018
# for which p(n) has the form k + 1⁄2, where k is an integer.
