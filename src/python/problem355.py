# Maximal coprime subset
# ======================
# Published on Sunday, 23rd October 2011, 10:00 am
#
# Define Co(n) to be the maximal possible sum of a set of mutually co-prime
# elements from {1, 2, ..., n}. For example Co(10) is 30 and hits that maximum
# on the subset {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}.     You are given that Co(30) = 193 and
# Co(100) = 1356.    Find Co(200000).
