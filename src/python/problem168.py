# Number Rotations

# Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the
# last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.  It can be verified that
# 714285=5142857.  This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a
# divisor of its right-rotation. Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all
# integers n, 10  n  10100, that have this property.
