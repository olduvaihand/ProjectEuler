# Pandigital prime sets
# =====================
# Published on Friday, 24th March 2006, 06:00 pm

# Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form
# decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set
# {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime. How many
# distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once
# contain only prime elements?
