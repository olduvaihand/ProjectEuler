# Consider the triangle with sides 5, 65 and 68.  It can be shown that this
# triangle has area 9. S(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with
# sides (1+b2), (1+c2) and (b2+c2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have
# an integral area not exceeding n. The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.
# S(106)=18018206. Find S(1010).
