# Diophantine reciprocals II
# ==========================
# Published on Friday, 2nd December 2005, 06:00 pm
#
# In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.    1 x  +  1 y
# =  1 n    It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct
# solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of
# distinct solutions exceeds one hundred. What is the least value of n for
# which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million? NOTE: This
# problem is a much more difficult version of problem 108 and as it is well
# beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever
# implementation.
