# ===================
# Published on Friday, 29th January 2010, 09:00 pm
#
# Consider the triangles with integer sides a, b and c with a  b  c.  An
# integer sided triangle (a,b,c) is called primitive if  gcd(a,b,c)=1.   How
# many primitive integer sided triangles exist with a perimeter not exceeding
# 10 000 000?
