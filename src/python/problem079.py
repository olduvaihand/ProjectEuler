# Passcode derivation
# ===================
# Published on Friday, 17th September 2004, 06:00 pm
#
# A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three
# random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278,
# they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would
# be: 317. The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.
# Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the
# file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown
# length.
