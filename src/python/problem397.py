# Triangle on parabola
# ====================
# Published on Sunday, 7th October 2012, 05:00 am
#
# On the parabola y = x2/k, three points A(a, a2/k), B(b, b2/k) and C(c, c2/k)
# are chosen.     Let F(K, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (k, a,
# b, c) such that at least one angle of the triangle ABC is 45-degree, with 1
# k  K and -X  a  b  c  X.     For example, F(1, 10) = 41 and F(10, 100) =
# 12492.  Find F(106, 109).
