# Goldbach's other conjecture
# ===========================
# Published on Friday, 20th June 2003, 06:00 pm
#
# It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be
# written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. 9 = 7 + 212  15 = 7 + 222
# 21 = 3 + 232  25 = 7 + 232  27 = 19 + 222  33 = 31 + 212 It turns out that
# the conjecture was false. What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be
# written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
