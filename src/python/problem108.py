# In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.    1 x  +  1 y
# =  1 n    For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:    1 5  +  1
# 20  =  1 4   1 6  +  1 12  =  1 4   1 8  +  1 8  =  1 4    What is the least
# value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?
# NOTE: This problem is an easier version of problem 110; it is strongly
# advised that you solve this one first.
