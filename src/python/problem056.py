# Powerful digit sum
# ==================
# Published on Friday, 7th November 2003, 06:00 pm
#
# A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
# 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
# Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
# Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b  100, what is the
# maximum digital sum?
