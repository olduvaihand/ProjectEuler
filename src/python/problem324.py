# Building a tower
# ================

# Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 33n tower with blocks of
# 211. You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however,
# rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct. For
# example (with q = 100000007) : f(2) = 229, f(4) = 117805, f(10) mod q =
# 96149360, f(103) mod q = 24806056, f(106) mod q = 30808124. Find f(1010000)
# mod 100000007.
