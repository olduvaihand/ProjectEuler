# Large repunit factors
# =====================
# Published on Friday, 1st December 2006, 06:00 pm
#
# A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
# R(k) to be a repunit of length k. For example, R(10) = 1111111111 =
# 11412719091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414. Find the sum of the
# first forty prime factors of R(109).
