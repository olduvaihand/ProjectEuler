# Scoring probabilities
# =====================
# Published on Saturday, 3rd April 2010, 05:00 am
#
# Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the
# probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is exactly (1
# - x/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50. During each practice run,
# she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2, ..., x = 50 and, according to
# her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20
# points. Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
