# Balanced Numbers

#
# A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first
# k/2 digits sum to the same value as its last k/2 digits, where x, pronounced
# ceiling of x, is the smallest integer  x, thus π = 4 and 5 = 5. So, for
# example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722. Let T(n) be the sum of
# all balanced numbers less than 10n.   Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) =
# 334795890.  Find T(47) mod 315
