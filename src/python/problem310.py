# Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.  Nim Square is just like ordinary
# three-heap normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a square number
# of stones from a heap.  The number of stones in the three heaps is
# represented by the ordered triple (a,b,c).  If 0abc29 then the number of
# losing positions for the next player is 1160.     Find the number of losing
# positions for the next player if 0abc100 000.
