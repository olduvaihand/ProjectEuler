#
# A spherical triangle is a figure formed on the surface of a sphere by three
# great circular arcs intersecting pairwise in three vertices.  Let C(r) be the
# sphere with the centre (0,0,0) and radius r.  Let Z(r) be the set of points
# on the surface of C(r) with integer coordinates.  Let T(r) be the set of
# spherical triangles with vertices in Z(r).  Degenerate spherical triangles,
# formed by three points on the same great arc, are not included in T(r).  Let
# A(r) be the area of the smallest spherical triangle in T(r). For example
# A(14) is 3.294040 rounded to six decimal places. Find  A(r). Give your answer
# rounded to six decimal places.
