# Prime cube partnership
# ======================
# Published on Friday, 10th November 2006, 06:00 pm
#
# There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n,
# such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube. For example, when p =
# 19, 83 + 8219 = 123. What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime
# with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such
# primes below one-hundred. How many primes below one million have this
# remarkable property?
