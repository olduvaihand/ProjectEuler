# Define f(0)=1 and f(n) to be the number of different ways n can be expressed
# as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power no more than twice. For
# example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10: 1 + 1 + 8
# 1 + 1 + 4 + 41 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4  2 + 4 + 4  2 + 8 What is f(1025)?
