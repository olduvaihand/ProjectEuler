# Crack-free Walls
# ================
# Published on Friday, 31st October 2008, 01:00 pm
#
# Consider the problem of building a wall out of 21 and 31 bricks
# (horizontalvertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps
# between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers,
# i.e. never form a "running crack". For example, the following 93 wall is not
# acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:    There are eight ways of
# forming a crack-free 93 wall, written W(9,3) = 8. Calculate W(32,10).
