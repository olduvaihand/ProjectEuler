# ==============
# Published on Saturday, 9th June 2012, 02:00 pm
#
# Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0  a,b,c  N.     From the origin
# O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.  Let D(N) be the
# number of distinct such lines.     You are given that D(1 000 000) =
# 831909254469114121.    Find D(1010). Give as your answer the first nine
# digits followed by the last nine digits.
