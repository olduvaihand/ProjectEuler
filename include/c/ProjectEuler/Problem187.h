 * A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For example,
 * 15 = 3  5; 9 = 3  3; 12 = 2  2  3. There are ten composites below thirty
 * containing precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors:  4, 6, 9,
 * 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26. How many composite integers, n  108, have
 * precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors?
