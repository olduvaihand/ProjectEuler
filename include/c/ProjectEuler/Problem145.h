 * How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?
 * ========================================================
 * Published on Friday, 16th March 2007, 01:00 pm
 *
 * Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n) ]
 * consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409
 * + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409, and 904
 * are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or reverse(n).
 * There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand. How many reversible
 * numbers are there below one-billion (109)?
