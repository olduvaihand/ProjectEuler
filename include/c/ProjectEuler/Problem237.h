 * Let T(n) be the number of tours over a 4  n playing board such that:  The
 * tour starts in the top left corner. The tour consists of moves that are up,
 * down, left, or right one square. The tour visits each square exactly once.
 * The tour ends in the bottom left corner.  The diagram shows one tour over a 4
 * 10 board:   T(10) is 2329. What is T(1012) modulo 108?
