 * Writing 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares
 * =======================================
 * Published on Friday, 27th April 2007, 02:00 pm
 *
 * There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares
 * using distinct integers. For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35}
 * can be used:  In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there
 * are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being:
 * {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}. How
 * many ways are there to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using
 * distinct integers between 2 and 80 inclusive?
