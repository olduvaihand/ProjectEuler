 * Goldbach's other conjecture
 * ===========================
 * Published on Friday, 20th June 2003, 06:00 pm
 *
 * It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be
 * written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. 9 = 7 + 212  15 = 7 + 222
 * 21 = 3 + 232  25 = 7 + 232  27 = 19 + 222  33 = 31 + 212 It turns out that
 * the conjecture was false. What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be
 * written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
