 * Squarefree Numbers
 * ==================
 * Published on Saturday, 10th May 2008, 01:00 pm
 *
 * A positive integer n is called squarefree, if no square of a prime divides n,
 * thus 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 are squarefree, but not 4, 8, 9, 12. How many
 * squarefree numbers are there below 250?
