 * Sum square difference

 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + ... +
 * 102 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 +
 * ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares
 * of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025  385 =
 * 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
 * hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
