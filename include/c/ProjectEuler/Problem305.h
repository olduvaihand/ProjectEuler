 *
 * Let's call S the (infinite) string that is made by concatenating the
 * consecutive positive integers (starting from 1)  written down in base 10.
 * Thus, S = 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242...     It's easy to see
 * that any number will show up an infinite number of times in S.     Let's call
 * f(n) the starting position of the nth occurrence of n in S.   For example,
 * f(1)=1, f(5)=81, f(12)=271 and f(7780)=111111365.     Find f(3k) for 1k13.
