 * Digit canceling fractions
 * =========================

 *
 * The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
 * in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which
 * is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s. We shall consider fractions
 * like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples. There are exactly four non-trivial
 * examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two
 * digits in the numerator and denominator. If the product of these four
 * fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the
 * denominator.
