 * Finding numbers for which the sum of the squares of the digits is a square.

 *
 * For a positive integer n, let f(n) be the sum of the squares of the digits
 * (in base 10) of n, e.g. f(3) = 32 = 9,  f(25) = 22 + 52 = 4 + 25 = 29,
 * f(442) = 42 + 42 + 22 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36 Find the last nine digits of the sum
 * of all n, 0  n  1020, such that f(n) is a perfect square.
