 * Nim Square
 * ==========
 * Published on Saturday, 13th November 2010, 07:00 pm
 *
 * Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.  Nim Square is just like ordinary
 * three-heap normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a square number
 * of stones from a heap.  The number of stones in the three heaps is
 * represented by the ordered triple (a,b,c).  If 0abc29 then the number of
 * losing positions for the next player is 1160.     Find the number of losing
 * positions for the next player if 0abc100 000.
