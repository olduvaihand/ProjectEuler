 * Cutting rope
 * ============
 * Published on Sunday, 14th October 2012, 08:00 am
 *
 * Inside a rope of length n, n-1 points are placed with distance 1 from each
 * other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose m-1 points at
 * random and cut the rope at these points to create m segments.     Let E(n, m)
 * be the expected length of the second-shortest segment.
