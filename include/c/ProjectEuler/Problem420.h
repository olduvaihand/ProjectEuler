 * 2x2 positive integer matrix
 * ===========================
 * Published on Sunday, 24th March 2013, 01:00 am
 *
 * A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive
 * integers.  Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a
 * positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:      We
 * define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a
 * trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive
 * integer matrix in two different ways.  We can verify that F(50) = 7 and
 * F(1000) = 1019.     Find F(107).
