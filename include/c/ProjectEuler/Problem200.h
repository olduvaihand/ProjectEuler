 * Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200"
 * ===========================================================================
 * Published on Saturday, 28th June 2008, 10:00 am
 *
 * We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, p2q3, where p and q are
 * distinct primes.  For example, 200 = 5223 or 120072949 = 232613. The first
 * five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500. Interestingly, 200 is also the
 * first number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we
 * shall call such numbers, prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which
 * contains the contiguous sub-string "200" is 1992008. Find the 200th prime-
 * proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200".
