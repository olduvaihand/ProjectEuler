 * Pandigital prime sets
 * =====================
 * Published on Friday, 24th March 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * Using all of the digits 1 through 9 and concatenating them freely to form
 * decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set
 * {2,5,47,89,631}, all of the elements belonging to it are prime. How many
 * distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once
 * contain only prime elements?
