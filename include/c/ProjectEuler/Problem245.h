 * Coresilience
 * ============
 * Published on Friday, 15th May 2009, 02:00 pm
 *
 * We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
 * Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the
 * ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4⁄11.
 * The resilience of a number d  1 is then φ(d) d - 1, where φ is Euler's
 * totient function.     We further define the coresilience of a number n  1 as
 * C(n)=  n - φ(n)  n - 1.   The coresilience of a prime p is C(p) =  1p - 1.
 * Find the sum of all composite integers 1  n  21011, for which C(n) is a unit
 * fraction.
