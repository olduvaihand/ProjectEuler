 * The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic
 * progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2  y2  z2 =
 * n, has exactly one solution when n = 20: 132  102  72 = 20 In fact there are
 * twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the equation has a unique
 * solution. How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one
 * solution?
