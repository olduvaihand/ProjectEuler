 * A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.
 * There are two basic forms:  If all possible orientations are taken into
 * account there are six:  Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can
 * be tiled with triominoes.  If we consider tilings that can be obtained by
 * reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2
 * by 9 grid can be  tiled with triominoes:  In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid
 * be tiled in this way by triominoes?
