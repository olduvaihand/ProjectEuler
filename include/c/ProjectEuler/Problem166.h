 * A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0  d  9. It can be seen that in the grid
 * 6 3 3 0  5 0 4 3  0 7 1 4  1 2 4 5 the sum of each row and each column has
 * the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12. In how many ways
 * can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0  d  9 so that each row, each
 * column, and both diagonals have the same sum?
