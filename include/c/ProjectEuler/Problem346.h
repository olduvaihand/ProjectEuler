 * Strong Repunits
 * ===============
 * Published on Saturday, 3rd September 2011, 04:00 pm
 *
 * The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11 written
 * in base 6 (i.e. 710 = 116 = 1112). In other words, 7 is a repunit in at least
 * two bases b > 1.      We shall call a positive integer with this property a
 * strong repunit. It can be verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50:
 * {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}. Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below
 * 1000 equals 15864.    Find the sum of all strong repunits below 1012.
