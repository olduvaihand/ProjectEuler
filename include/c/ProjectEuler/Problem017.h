 * Number letter counts
 * ====================
 * Published on Friday, 17th May 2002, 06:00 pm
 *
 * If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,
 * then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the
 * numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words,
 * how many letters would be used?   NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For
 * example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one
 * hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out
 * numbers is in compliance with British usage.
