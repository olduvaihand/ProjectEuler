 * Prime square remainders
 * =======================
 * Published on Friday, 16th June 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when
 * (pn1)n + (pn+1)n is divided by pn2. For example, when n = 3, p3 = 5, and 43 +
 * 63 = 280  5 mod 25. The least value of n for which the remainder first
 * exceeds 109 is 7037. Find the least value of n for which the remainder first
 * exceeds 1010.
