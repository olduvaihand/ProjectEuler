 * Digit power sum

 *
 * The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits
 * raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 83 = 512. Another example of a
 * number with this property is 614656 = 284. We shall define an to be the nth
 * term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two
 * digits to have a sum. You are given that a2 = 512 and a10 = 614656. Find a30.
