 * Right-angled triangles that share a cathetus.
 * =============================================
 * Published on Friday, 4th January 2008, 05:00 pm
 *
 * The four right-angled triangles with sides (9,12,15), (12,16,20), (5,12,13)
 * and (12,35,37) all have one of the shorter sides (catheti) equal to 12. It
 * can be shown that no other integer sided right-angled triangle exists with
 * one of the catheti equal to 12. Find the smallest integer that can be the
 * length of a cathetus of exactly 47547 different integer sided right-angled
 * triangles.
