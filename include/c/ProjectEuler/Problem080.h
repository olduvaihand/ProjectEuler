 * Square root digital expansion
 * =============================
 * Published on Friday, 8th October 2004, 06:00 pm
 *
 * It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an
 * integer, then it is irrational. The decimal expansion of such square roots is
 * infinite without any repeating pattern at all. The square root of two is
 * 1.41421356237309504880..., and the digital sum of the first one hundred
 * decimal digits is 475. For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the
 * total of the digital sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the
 * irrational square roots.
