 * Generalised Hamming Numbers
 * ===========================
 * Published on Saturday, 6th September 2008, 02:00 pm
 *
 * A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger than
 * 5.  So the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.
 * There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 108. We will call a positive
 * number a generalised Hamming number of type n, if it has no prime factor
 * larger than n.  Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers
 * of type 5. How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are there which
 * don't exceed 109?
