 * Amicable chains
 * ===============

 *
 * The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number
 * itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the
 * sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.
 * Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the
 * proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this
 * reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair. Perhaps less well known are
 * longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five
 * numbers: 12496  14288  15472  14536  14264 ( 12496  ...) Since this chain
 * returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain. Find the
 * smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one
 * million.
