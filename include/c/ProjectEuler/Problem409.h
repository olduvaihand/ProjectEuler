 *
 * Let n be a positive integer. Consider nim positions where: There are n non-
 * empty piles.  Each pile has size less than 2n.  No two piles have the same
 * size.   Let W(n) be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the above
 * conditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning
 * strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2) = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360 and
 * W(100) mod 1 000 000 007 = 384777056.   Find W(10 000 000) mod 1 000 000 007.
