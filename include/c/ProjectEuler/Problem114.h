 * Counting block combinations I
 * =============================
 * Published on Friday, 17th February 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * A row measuring seven units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of
 * three units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to
 * be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square. There are
 * exactly seventeen ways of doing this.
 * How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled? NOTE:
 * Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility, in
 * general it is permitted to mix block sizes. For example, on a row measuring
 * eight units in length you could use red (3), black (1), and red (4).
