 * Polynomials with at least one integer root

 *
 * A root or zero of a polynomial P(x) is a solution to the equation P(x) = 0.
 * Define Pn as the polynomial whose coefficients are the digits of n.  For
 * example, P5703(x) = 5x3 + 7x2 + 3. We can see that: Pn(0) is the last digit
 * of n, Pn(1) is the sum of the digits of n, Pn(10) is n itself. Define Z(k) as
 * the number of positive integers, n, not exceeding k for which the polynomial
 * Pn has at least one integer root. It can be verified that Z(100 000) is
 * 14696. What is Z(1016)?
