 * ======================
 * Published on Friday, 22nd May 2009, 05:00 pm
 *
 * A definition for an ellipse is:  Given a circle c with centre M and radius r
 * and a point G such that d(G,M)r, the locus of the points that are equidistant
 * from c and G form an ellipse.    The construction of the points of the
 * ellipse is shown below.
