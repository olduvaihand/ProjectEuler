 * Sum of Squares

 *
 * Consider equations of the form: a2 + b2 = N, 0  a  b, a, b and N integer. For
 * N=65 there are two solutions: a=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7. We call S(N) the sum of
 * the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 = N, 0  a  b, a, b and N integer.
 * Thus S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5. Find S(N), for all squarefree N only divisible by
 * primes of the form 4k+1 with 4k+1  150.
