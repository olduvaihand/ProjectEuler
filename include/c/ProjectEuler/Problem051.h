 * Prime digit replacements
 * ========================
 * Published on Friday, 29th August 2003, 06:00 pm
 *
 * By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of
 * the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime. By
 * replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit
 * number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated
 * numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and
 * 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the
 * smallest prime with this property. Find the smallest prime which, by
 * replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same
 * digit, is part of an eight prime value family.
