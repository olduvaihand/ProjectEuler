 * Squarefree factors
 * ==================
 * Published on Sunday, 11th December 2011, 07:00 am
 *
 * Consider the number 54.  54 can be factored in 7 distinct ways into one or
 * more factors larger than 1:  54, 227, 318, 69, 336, 239 and 2333.  If we
 * require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain: 336 and
 * 2333.     Let's call Fsf(n) the number of ways n can be factored into one or
 * more squarefree factors larger than 1, so  Fsf(54)=2.     Let S(n) be Fsf(k)
 * for k=2 to n.     S(100)=193.     Find S(10 000 000 000).
