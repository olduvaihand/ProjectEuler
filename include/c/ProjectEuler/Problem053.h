 * Combinatoric selections
 * =======================
 * Published on Friday, 26th September 2003, 06:00 pm
 *
 * There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345: 123, 124,
 * 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345 In combinatorics, we use the
 * notation, 5C3 = 10. In general,    nCr =  n!r!(nr)! ,where r  n, n! =
 * n(n1)...321, and 0! = 1.    It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-
 * million: 23C10 = 1144066. How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  nCr,
 * for 1  n  100, are greater than one-million?
