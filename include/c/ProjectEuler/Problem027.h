 * Quadratic primes
 * ================

 *
 * Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: n² + n + 41 It turns out
 * that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to
 * 39. However, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41,
 * and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41. The
 * incredible formula  n²  79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes
 * for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the coefficients, 79
 * and 1601, is 126479. Considering quadratics of the form:  n² + an + b, where
 * |a|  1000 and |b|  1000 where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of ne.g. |11|
 * = 11 and |4| = 4  Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the
 * quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for
 * consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
