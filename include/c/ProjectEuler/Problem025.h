 * 1000-digit Fibonacci number
 * ===========================
 * Published on Friday, 30th August 2002, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: Fn = Fn1 + Fn2,
 * where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1. Hence the first 12 terms will be: F1 = 1  F2 = 1  F3
 * = 2  F4 = 3  F5 = 5  F6 = 8  F7 = 13  F8 = 21  F9 = 34  F10 = 55  F11 = 89
 * F12 = 144 The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits. What
 * is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
