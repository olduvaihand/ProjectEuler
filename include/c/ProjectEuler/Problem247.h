 * Squares under a hyperbola
 * =========================
 * Published on Friday, 29th May 2009, 09:00 pm
 *
 * Consider the region constrained by 1  x and 0  y  1/x.    Let S1 be the
 * largest square that can fit under the curve.  Let S2 be the largest square
 * that fits in the remaining area, and so on.   Let the index of Sn be the pair
 * (left, below) indicating the number of squares to the left of Sn and the
 * number of squares below Sn.       The diagram shows some such squares
 * labelled by number.   S2 has one square to its left and none below, so the
 * index of S2 is (1,0).  It can be seen that the index of S32 is (1,1) as is
 * the index of S50.   50 is the largest n for which the index of Sn is (1,1).
 * What is the largest n for which the index of Sn is (3,3)?
