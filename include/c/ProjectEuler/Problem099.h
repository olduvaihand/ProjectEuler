 * Largest exponential
 * ===================
 * Published on Friday, 1st July 2005, 06:00 pm
 *
 * Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult,
 * as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048  37 = 2187. However,
 * confirming that 632382518061  519432525806 would be much more difficult, as
 * both numbers contain over three million digits. Using base_exp.txt (right
 * click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand
 * lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has
 * the greatest numerical value. NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent
 * the numbers in the example given above.
