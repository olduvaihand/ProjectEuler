 * Powerful digit sum
 * ==================
 * Published on Friday, 7th November 2003, 06:00 pm
 *
 * A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
 * 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
 * Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
 * Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b  100, what is the
 * maximum digital sum?
