 * Large repunit factors
 * =====================
 * Published on Friday, 1st December 2006, 06:00 pm
 *
 * A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
 * R(k) to be a repunit of length k. For example, R(10) = 1111111111 =
 * 11412719091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414. Find the sum of the
 * first forty prime factors of R(109).
