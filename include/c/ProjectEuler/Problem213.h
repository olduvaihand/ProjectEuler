 * Flea Circus
 * ===========
 * Published on Saturday, 18th October 2008, 10:00 am
 *
 * A 3030 grid of squares contains 900 fleas, initially one flea per square.
 * When a bell is rung, each flea jumps to an adjacent square at random (usually
 * 4 possibilities, except for fleas on the edge of the grid or at the corners).
 * What is the expected number of unoccupied squares after 50 rings of the bell?
 * Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.
