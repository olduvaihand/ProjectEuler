 * Fractional Sequences
 * ====================
 * Published on Saturday, 18th June 2011, 04:00 pm
 *
 * For any positive integer k, a finite sequence ai of fractions xi/yi is
 * defined by:  a1 = 1/k and  ai = (xi-1+1)/(yi-1-1) reduced to lowest terms for
 * i>1.  When ai reaches some integer n, the sequence stops. (That is, when
 * yi=1.)  Define f(k) = n.   For example, for k = 20:     1/20  2/19  3/18 =
 * 1/6  2/5  3/4  4/3  5/2  6/1 = 6     So f(20) = 6.     Also f(1) = 1, f(2) =
 * 2, f(3) = 1 and Σf(k3) = 118937 for 1  k  100.     Find Σf(k3) for 1  k
 * 2106.
