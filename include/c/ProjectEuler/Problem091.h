 * Right triangles with integer coordinates
 * ========================================
 * Published on Friday, 18th March 2005, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and
 * are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.    There are exactly fourteen
 * triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate
 * lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,0  x1, y1, x2, y2  2.    Given that 0
 * x1, y1, x2, y2  50, how many right triangles can be formed?
