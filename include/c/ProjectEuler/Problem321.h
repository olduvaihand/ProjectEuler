 * Swapping Counters
 * =================
 * Published on Sunday, 23rd January 2011, 01:00 am
 *
 * A horizontal row comprising of 2n + 1 squares has n red counters placed at
 * one end and n blue counters at the other end, being separated by a single
 * empty square in the centre. For example, when n = 3.  A counter can move from
 * one square to the next (slide) or can jump over another counter (hop) as long
 * as the square next to that counter is unoccupied.  Let M(n) represent the
 * minimum number of moves/actions to completely reverse the positions of the
 * coloured counters; that is, move all the red counters to the right and all
 * the blue counters to the left. It can be verified M(3) = 15, which also
 * happens to be a triangle number. If we create a sequence based on the values
 * of n for which M(n) is a triangle number then the first five terms would be:
 * 1, 3, 10, 22, and 63, and their sum would be 99. Find the sum of the first
 * forty terms of this sequence.
