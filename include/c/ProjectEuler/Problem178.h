 *
 * Consider the number 45656.   It can be seen that each pair of consecutive
 * digits of 45656 has a difference of one.  A number for which every pair of
 * consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.  A
 * pandigital number  contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.
 * How many pandigital step numbers less than 1040 are there?
