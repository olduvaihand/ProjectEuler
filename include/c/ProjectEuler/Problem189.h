 * Tri-colouring a triangular grid
 * ===============================
 * Published on Friday, 11th April 2008, 05:00 pm
 *
 * Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:  We wish to colour the
 * interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so
 * that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring
 * shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if
 * they share an edge.  Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not
 * neighbours. For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:  A
 * colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection
 * is considered distinct from C unless the two are identical. How many distinct
 * valid colourings are there for the above configuration?
