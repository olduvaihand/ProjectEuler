 * Truncatable primes
 * ==================
 * Published on Friday, 14th February 2003, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is
 * possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime
 * at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to
 * left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3. Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are
 * both truncatable from left to right and right to left. NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7
 * are not considered to be truncatable primes.
