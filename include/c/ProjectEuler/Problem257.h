 * Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a  b  c.   (AB = c, BC = a
 * and AC = b).  The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at
 * points E, F and G (see picture below).        The segments EF, EG and FG
 * partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and
 * EFG.  It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio
 * area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.  However, there exist triangles for
 * which some or all of these ratios are integral.     How many triangles ABC
 * with perimeter100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is
 * integral?
