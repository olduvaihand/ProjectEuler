 * Using up to one million tiles how many different "hollow" square laminae can be formed?
 * =======================================================================================

 *
 * We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole"
 * so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example,
 * using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square
 * laminae:    With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the
 * tiles at one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.
 * Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be
 * formed?
