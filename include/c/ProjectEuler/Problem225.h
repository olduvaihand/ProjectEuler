 * The sequence 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, 653, 1201 ...  is
 * defined by T1 = T2 = T3 = 1 and Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 + Tn-3.     It can be shown
 * that 27 does not divide any terms of this sequence.In fact, 27 is the first
 * odd number with this property.   Find the 124th odd number that does not
 * divide any terms of the above sequence.
