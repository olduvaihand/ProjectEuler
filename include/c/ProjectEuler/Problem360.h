 * Given two points (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) in three dimensional space, the
 * Manhattan distance  between those points is defined as
 * |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|+|z1-z2|.     Let C(r) be a sphere with radius r and center in
 * the origin O(0,0,0).  Let I(r) be the set of all points with integer
 * coordinates on the surface of C(r).  Let S(r) be the sum of the Manhattan
 * distances of all elements of I(r) to the origin O.     E.g. S(45)=34518.
 * Find S(1010).
