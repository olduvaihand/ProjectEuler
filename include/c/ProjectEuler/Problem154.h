 * Exploring Pascal's pyramid.
 * ===========================
 * Published on Saturday, 12th May 2007, 06:00 am
 *
 * A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball
 * rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.  Then, we calculate the
 * number of paths leading from the apex to each position: A path starts at the
 * apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres directly below the
 * current position. Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain
 * position is the sum of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the
 * position, there are up to three numbers above it). The result is Pascal's
 * pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the coefficients of the trinomial
 * expansion   (x + y + z)n. How many coefficients in the expansion of (x + y +
 * z)200000 are multiples of 1012?
