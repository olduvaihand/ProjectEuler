 * Longest Collatz sequence
 * ========================
 * Published on Friday, 5th April 2002, 06:00 pm
 *
 * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 * n  n/2 (n is even) n  3n + 1 (n is odd) Using the rule above and starting
 * with 13, we generate the following sequence: 13  40  20  10  5  16  8  4  2
 * 1 It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
 * contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it
 * is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1. Which starting number,
 * under one million, produces the longest chain? NOTE: Once the chain starts
 * the terms are allowed to go above one million.
