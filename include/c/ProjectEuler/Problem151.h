 * Paper sheets of standard sizes: an expected-value problem.
 * ==========================================================
 * Published on Friday, 20th April 2007, 06:00 pm
 *
 * A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a
 * sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5. Every Monday morning, the
 * foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper
 * with size A1. He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size
 * A2. Then he cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on
 * until he obtains the A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week.
 * All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.  At the beginning of
 * each subsequent batch, he takes from the envelope one sheet of paper at
 * random. If it is of size A5, he uses it. If it is larger, he repeats the
 * 'cut-in-half' procedure until he has what he needs and any remaining sheets
 * are always placed back in the envelope. Excluding the first and last batch of
 * the week, find the expected number of times (during each week) that the
 * foreman finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope. Give your answer
 * rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .
