 * Firecracker
 * ===========
 * Published on Saturday, 1st January 2011, 04:00 pm
 *
 * A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks
 * into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction;
 * all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.     We assume that the
 * fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with
 * g=9.81 m/s2.     Find the volume (in m3) of the region through which the
 * fragments move before reaching the ground.   Give your answer rounded to four
 * decimal places.
