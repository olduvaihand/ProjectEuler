 * Maximum path sum II
 * ===================
 * Published on Friday, 9th April 2004, 06:00 pm
 *
 * By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers
 * on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. 3 7 4  2 4 6  8
 * 5 9 3 That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23. Find the maximum total from top to bottom
 * in triangle.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file
 * containing a triangle with one-hundred rows. NOTE: This is a much more
 * difficult version of Problem 18. It is not possible to try every route to
 * solve this problem, as there are 299 altogether! If you could check one
 * trillion (1012) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years
 * to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
